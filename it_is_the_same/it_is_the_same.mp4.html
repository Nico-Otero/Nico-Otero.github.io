TMM_text.innerHTML = "it_is_the_same.mp4 was my first film for my 181 class. Our task was supposed to be to make a film about your everyday life and make it interesting or different from how others would perceive it. Another task was to just film and not have a set plan. My end result was an old VHS-style, Mandella catalog-type thing with robotic voices, grainy images, and tons of static.";

var TMM01 = "This was the ending screen. A main theme I was going for was repetition. I repeated phrases, images, and videos throughout the film, hence the name It is the Same. I gave it the mp4 name to make the video look like lost media—an unknown source kind of thing."

var TMM02 = "The eyes were another part of the video, near the end. Throughout the film, for any pictures or videos of people I had found, I covered their eyes, with the only eyes being an extreme close up and some sad-looking. I was tired of repetition at this point in my life. Starting from this point, I vowed to do new things."

var TMM03 = "This is where one of the robotic voices came from. I had to use an AI robot voice recorder to get the right narrator. It would ONLY take what I wrote and say it back to me; it did not do anything else. It was perfect for what I wanted—a little cliche, but it worked."
